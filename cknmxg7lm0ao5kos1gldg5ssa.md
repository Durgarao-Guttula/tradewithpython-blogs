## List of Low Code/No Code Algorithmic Trading Platforms in India

Hi There üòá, in this article, we will be covering the list of all available No-Code to Low-Code Algorithmic Trading platforms developed in and for India. 

**Why am I writing on this, considering I plan to educate Algo-Trading using Python? **

Frankly, learning Python actually to start Algo-Trading has a steep learning curve. Until you get there, these No-Code Algo Trading platforms are a chance for you to actually backtest the strategy you have in mind and even do paper/live trading after connecting your broker. 

These platforms are also an excellent opportunity to learn more about the terminology used when creating algos for trading, **for example, slippage, backtest, brokerage, commission, drawdowns, etc. **

Below is the list of platforms; I have tried to personally analyze them for you with some comments for better decision making. Frankly, the technology behind all of these platforms is amazing, and I envy the founders of each one of these. If you find any material errors in my comments, please do reach out to me to fix them. If I have missed any other No-Code/Low-Code platform based out of India, drop me a line, and I will analyze and add it (giving you full credit)

- ** [Keev:](https://bit.ly/3txkHpu)** Keev is one of the newest platforms in India in the Algo-Trading space, they are in the Beta phase at the moment. What I really like about this platform is that they allow you to visualize your strategy while building it (see screenshot below), and they have a fast backtesting framework; you can also run multiple iterations with different conditions of your strategy in one click (like stop-loss, rebalancing, profit%) to see when it performs best. They currently only support Zerodha and Angel Broking for live trading, and they do not have Options backtesting at the moment.

### Low-Code Platforms

-  **[Algoji:](https://bit.ly/3x2kay5)** This platform is also quite famous, but unlike others, it does not allow you to create your own strategies. Instead, AlgoJi provides the fastest APIBridge, which can connect with multiple brokers for the fastest order execution time (50ms latency), which is very, very good; you can also connect this bridge with existing trading software like Amibroker, MT4. It also has a product, VPS4Trading, where they help you host your strategies on a Virtual Server. 
Their product MyCoder allows anyone with a strategy to come and talk to their developers, who will charge between Rs 10,000/- to Rs 50,000/- depending on complexity.
