## Back to Basics 101: How to Install Python the correct way?

Hi There!

Although you must have already done a quick Google search on
**"How to Install Python"** and you must have probably figured out that already given there are so many google results.

But for the benefit of my readers who are just getting started with Python and would like to get detailed steps on how to install it, here is one more blog on this. FYI - the installation steps are for the **Anaconda Distribution ** since it has a lot of libraries pre-installed which are important for doing analysis on large datasets (Hi Traders ðŸ¤“)  
More on those libraries in future articles but for now just trust me. There is also data proving that "Anaconda" works faster than normal Python installation. (Source:  [www.pythonspeed.com](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/faster-python/) )

> I will only be covering the **Windows** installation in this article. If you want me to cover other OS, let me know in comments ðŸ˜…

### Step 1: Download File from Website
Head over to Anaconda by clicking  [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  
Scroll to the very bottom of the page until you see **Anaconda Installers**

Depending on your machine install the 32-bit or 64-bit version. If you are confused about which version is your machine, type `dxdiag` into your Windows Search Bar and press Enter, if you get a popup - just select Yes/OK. The highlighted bit in the image below will give you that information.

Yes guys I am using a **4GB RAM** ðŸ˜­ laptop, clearly you all need to buy me more coffee. 

### Step 2: Install the File
Run the downloaded *Anaconda3-2020.11-Windows-x86_64.exe* file and go ahead with all the default options and you will see the installation start automatically. Should only take a couple of minutes to complete.

### Step 3: Verify if Python is now installed
Go to your Windows search bar and type in `anaconda` and select **Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)**

You should see a black dialog box popup showing *(base) C:\Users\yourcomputername*

Type in `python` in your black dialog box and if the installation is correct, it should look something similar to below. My installation of Python 3.8.5 was successful.

### Step 4: Writing your first Python Command
We will do a quick print ***Hello World*** in Python by using the command below.

```
print("Hello World")
```
The console should also return "Hello World" just like in the screenshot below.

And that's a wrap! You just installed Python and even wrote your first line of Python code! 
Pat yourselves on the back, it's a start to an amazing journey. ðŸš€
